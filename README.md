# Superman

This website provide human resource for any kind of job to do.

# Tools 

The website is built and developed using the Xampp.
Instructions for installing Xampp can be found [here]( https://github.com/ASIFALRAFI00/CSE327.5_Fall_2020_Project_Superman/wiki/Documentation-Tool)
In your XAMPP control panel window, you should see a simple layout of which XAMPP processes are running. For our purposes, we will focus on the first two options: Apache and MySQL.
Press the Start button in your XAMPP control panel under Actions for both Apache and MySQL. Wait until both Apache and MySQL are highlighted green under your module section. Once enabled, you're free to use XAMPP.

# Localhost and phpMyAdmin

To ensure everything is in working order, open a web browser, enter http://localhost/ into your address bar and hit Enter. You should be redirected to http://localhost/dashboard/, which is the default XAMPP page.
Next, click on the phpMyAdmin button on the top navigation menu. You'll be directed to your default phpMyAdmin page. Leave these alone for now, but if both are working you're ready to start creating websites!

# Now create login page using html-css-php-mysql with xmpp
